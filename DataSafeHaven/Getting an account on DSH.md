# Getting an account on Data Safe Haven 

## Step 1

Complete [Information Governance](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/it-for-slms/research-ig/information-governance-training-awareness-service) assurance process and upload your course certificate as required.

## Step 2

Let the IAA (Information Asset Administrator) for the share know you have done step 1; for now that is [Sarah Keating](mailto:s.keating@ucl.ac.uk).

## Step 3

The IAA will request that you be added and you will receive an email asking you to choose and attend a session with the DSH where you will get your credentials.

***Note to IAA***: Leave sufficient time between the certificate being uploaded and trying to create a new user for the certificate to have been fully recorded in the IDS systems.

## Step 4

Let the IAA know you have done the DSH onboarding and send them your DSH ID. They will then add you to the CHIMERA shared data.
